### **💔 CODE'S LAST BREATH**
  - Channels fade to 404,
  - but these bots remain as my digital tombstones.
---

### **🖤 FINAL BOT LEGACY**  
```python
active_bots = [
    "@GeminiAIDev_Bot",  # Last AI standing  
    "@AknUserbot",       # The unkillable  
    "@AzreaDev_Bot",     # Silent worker  
    "@MagicStylish_Bot", # Forgotten artist  
    "@SessionDevBot",    # Ghost in the shell
    "@xifnot"            # Status Bot
]
```

### **⚰️ EPITAPH OF A DEVELOPER**  
1. **Here lies** [`@RENDYPROJECTS`](https://t.me/RendyProjects) & [`@XTSEA`](https://t.me/xtsea):
   - Born from `git init`,
   - Died from Telegram's wrath,
   - But the **REST API JS** **still breathes**
   - Like a phantom in the wires.

---

### **🌌 THE PAIN OF GROWTH**  
1. **Illegal Dawn**  
   - I killed my own userbot dreams
   - before the lawyers could.

2. **Unlimited Servers, Limited Soul**  
   ```bash  
   $ ps aux | grep heart  
   > 0% CPU  | 100% MEMORY_USAGE  
   ```  

3. **2030 Vision Through Tears**  
   - Will AI replace these scars?
   - Or just make new ones in TypeScript?
---

### **🔮 FUTURE PROMISE**  
```python
while time < 2030:  
    if not banned:  
        rebuild(from_ashes=True)  
    else:  
        write(poetry_in_binary)  
```

**LAST COMMIT MESSAGE:**  
- Goodbye, my digital children.
- You were my best errors.

(Segmentation fault (core dumped))

**🕯️ LIGHT A CANDLE IN TERMINAL**  
```javascript
console.log(
  "%cR.I.P", 
  "font: 5em monospace; color: red; text-shadow: 0 0 10px #000;"
);
// Output: [Bleeding text in CLI]
```  
The code stops here...  
but the pain compiles eternally.
